Within-pipeline factors:
	AGEN latency = 1 cycle
	Store Queue (SQ): SQ size = window size, oracle memory disambiguation, store-load forwarding = 1 cycle after store's or load's agen.
	* Note: A store searches the L1$ at commit. The store is released
	* from the SQ and window, whether it hits or misses. Store misses
	* are buffered until the block is allocated and the store is
	* performed in the L1$. While buffered, conflicting loads get
	* the store's data as they would from the SQ.
